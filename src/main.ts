/*
 * creating the store is the only thing that might take time, but its better than having an unmanageable state in the future.
 * billion's store is based on flux state management by facebook (https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/in-depth-overview#structure-and-data-flow)
 * and on clean archetecture by uncle bob (https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).
 * in short:
 *   - mutations are the only functions that are allowed to directly change the state and cause a re-render, they should be called only from inside usecases.
 *   - usecases are responisble of carrying the business logic like api calls, usecases also have access to mutations and repository.
 *   - repository is responsible of returning data from state to the app.
